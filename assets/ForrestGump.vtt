00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.370
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) That day, for no particular reason, I decided

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.490
to go for a little run.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.830
So, I ran to the end of the

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.190
road.

5
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.710
And when I got there, I thought maybe

6
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.910
I'd run to the end of town.

7
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.950
President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion, fell into

8
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.330
the arms of...

9
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.910
And when I got there, I thought maybe

10
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.790
I'd just run across Greenbow County.

11
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.910
And I figured since I'd run this far,

12
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.630
maybe I'd just run across the great state

13
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.090
of Alabama.

14
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.110
And that's what I did.

15
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.350
I ran clear across Alabama.

16
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.750
For no particular reason, I just kept on

17
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.030
going.

18
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.570
I ran clear of the ocean.

19
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.070
And when I got there, I figured since

20
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.210
I'd gone this far, I might as well

21
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.030
turn around and just keep on going.

22
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.860
But when I got to another ocean, I

23
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.860
figured since I'd gone this far, I might

24
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.940
as well just turn back and keep right

25
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.420
on going.

26
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.240
When I got tired, I slept.

27
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.600
When I got hungry, I ate.

28
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.160
When I had to go, you know, I

29
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.440
went.

30
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.040
And so, you just ran.

31
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.420
Yeah.

32
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.160
Lookin' at her before the rushin' on the

33
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.400
road.

34
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.970
Thankin' so many songs.

35
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.830
Sixty-five, I was seventeen when I put

36
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.570
her up on the road.

37
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.090
I'd think a lot about Mama and Bubba

38
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.310
and Lieutenant Dane.

39
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.470
But most of all, I thought about Jenny.

40
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.130
I thought about her a lot.

41
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.290
For more than two years now, a man

42
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.070
named Forrest Gump, a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,

43
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.030
stopping only to sleep, has been running across

44
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.730
America.

45
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.670
Charles Cooper brings you his report.

46
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.830
For the fourth time on his journey across

47
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.890
America, Forrest Gump, a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,

48
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.430
is about to cross the Mississippi River again

49
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.870
today.

50
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.970
I'll be damned.

51
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.910
Sir, why are you running?

52
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.990
Why are you running?

53
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.910
Are you doing this for world peace?

54
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.110
Are you doing this for the homeless?

55
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.170
Are you running for women's rights?

56
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.250
Or for the environment?

57
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.290
Or for animals?

58
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.570
They just couldn't believe that somebody would do

59
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.670
all that running for no particular reason.

60
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.210
Why are you doing this?

61
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.830
I just felt like running.

62
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.650
I just felt like running.

63
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.650
Shoot.

64
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.350
I can't believe it was really you.

65
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.430
No.

66
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.990
For some reason, what I was doing seemed

67
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.110
to make sense to people.

68
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.450
I mean, it was like an alarm went

69
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.210
off in my head, you know?

70
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.930
I said, here's a guy who's got his

71
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.350
act together.

72
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.390
Here's somebody who's got it all figured out.

73
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.910
Here's somebody who has the answer.

74
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.510
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

75
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.430
So I got company.

76
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.910
And after that, I got more company.

77
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.250
And then even more people joined in.

78
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.790
Somebody later told me it gave people hope.

79
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.190
Nah.

80
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.910
Nah, I don't know anything about that.

81
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.570
But some of those people asked me if

82
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.510
I could help them out.

83
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.410
Hey, man.

84
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.310
Hey, listen, I was wondering if you might

85
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.850
help me, huh?

86
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.150
Listen, I'm in the bumper sticker business, and

87
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.270
I've been trying to think up a good

88
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.630
slogan.

89
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.190
And since you have been such a big

90
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.410
inspiration to the people around here, I thought

91
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.590
you might be able to help me jump

92
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.950
into it.

93
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.910
Whoa, man!

94
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.830
You just ran through a big pile of

95
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.450
dog shit!

96
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.130
It happens.

97
00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.970
What, shit?

98
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.830
Sometimes.

99
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.830
And some years later, I heard that that

100
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.370
fella did come up with a bumper sticker

101
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.030
slogan, and he made a lot of money

102
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.650
off of it.

103
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.350
Another time, I was running along, somebody who

104
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.850
had lost all his money in the T

105
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.950
-shirt business, and he wanted to put my

106
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.690
face on a T-shirt, but he couldn't

107
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.670
draw that well, and he didn't have a

108
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.010
camera.

109
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.290
Here, use this one.

110
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.390
Nobody likes that color anyway.

111
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.030
Have a nice day.

112
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.890
Well, some years later, I found out that

113
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.670
that man did come up with an idea

114
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.570
for a T-shirt, and he made a

115
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.510
lot of money off of it.

116
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.790
Anyway, like I was saying, I had a

117
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.470
lot of company.

118
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.050
My mom always said, you got to put

119
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.210
the past behind you before you can move

120
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.610
on, and I think that's what my running

121
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.470
was all about.

122
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.110
I had run for 3 years, 2 months,

123
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.730
14 days, and 16 hours.

124
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.330
Quiet, he's gonna say something.

125
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.020
I'm pretty tired.

126
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.670
I think I'll go home now.

127
00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:00.840
Thank you for watching.
